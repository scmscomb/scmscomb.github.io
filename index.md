_**Maximal 3-wise intersecting families**_       
[zoom](https://zoom.us/j/89732289081?pwd=QXl5SVJHcTR0UVFRSzhjeVpBRTlSZz09) pw 121323

A family F of subsets of {1,2,…,n} is called maximal k-wise intersecting if every collection of at most k members from F has a common element, and moreover, no set can be added to F while preserving this property. 
In 1974, Erdős and Kleitman asked for the smallest possible size of a maximal k-wise intersecting family, for k≥3. 
We resolve this problem for k=3 and n even and sufficiently large.

This is joint work with Ben Lund, Kevin Hendrey, Casey Tompkins.

_**Colouring graphs of bounded local density**_       

What is the best upper bound on the chromatic number for graphs of given maximum degree $\Delta$ and given maximum local density -- that is, with neighbourhood subgraphs each inducing at most a certain edge density? This Ramsey-type problem has deep roots going back more than half a century, for example, to a question of Vizing from the 1960s on triangle-free graphs, corresponding to local density 0. I will give a quick survey of the history of this question, particularly for large $\Delta$, including discussion of some selected related problems (such as the conjecture of Erdos and Nesetril). Then I will discuss some recent progress on this problem, with emphasis on the regime of dense (i.e. $\Theta(\Delta)$) local sparsity. This talk will touch on numerous joint works with, variously, Davies, Hurley, de Joannis de Verclos, Pirot, Sereni.

_**Balanced subdivisions of a large clique in graphs with high average degree**_     

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
In 1984, Thomassen conjectured that for every constant k &in; N, there exists d such that every graph with average degree at least d contains a subdivision of a complete graph on k vertices in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. Recently, Liu and Montgomery confirmed Thomassen's conjecture. In this talk, we show that for sufficiently large d, every n-vertex graph with average degree at least d contains a subdivision of a complete graph of size at least &Omega;(d<sup>1/2</sup>/log<sup>10</sup>n) in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times.

We prove that with high probability, the random graph G(n,1/2) on an even number of vertices admits a partition of its vertex set into two parts of equal size in which n − o(n) vertices have more neighbours on their own side than across. This settles an old conjecture of Furedi from 1988, which also appears as Problem 91 in Green’s list of 100 open problems.

_**A short survey on properly colored connectivity of graphs**_     [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JQ4y1z7sC/)


<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   

We consider edge-colored connected graphs. An edge-colored graph is called properly colored if no two adjacent edges share a color. 
We say that an edge-colored graph is properly connected, if between every pair of distinct vertices, there exists a properly colored path connecting them. 
In this talk, we focus on edge-colored graphs that are properly connected and some recent results in this topic will be reviewed.

  <summary>abstract</summary>   

Dirac proved that every n-vertex graph with minimum degree at least n/2 contains a hamiltonian cycle. We prove an analogue for hypergraphs: we give exact bounds for the minimum degree of a uniform hypergraph that implies the existence of hamiltonian Berge cycles. This is joint work with Alexandr Kostochka and Grace McCourt.

  A graph is called a ternary graph if it has no induced cycle of length divisible by 3. We prove Engstr\"{o}m's conjecture that the independence complex of a ternary graph is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere.
Our result strengthens a result by Zhang and Wu, which verifies a conjecture of Kalai and Meshulam about the total Betti number of the independence complex of ternary graphs.

_**Sufficient conditions for 2-dimensional graph rigidity**_          [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kv41137iL/)

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
  A graph is rigid in R<sup>d</sup> if one places the vertices of the graph in the R<sup>d</sup>, in general position, there will be no simultaneous continuous motion of all the points, other than Euclidean congruences, that preserves the lengths of all the graph edges.  In R<sup>2</sup>, Geiringer in 1927, and independently Laman in 1970, gave a nice combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs.  Using another characterization, Lovasz and Yemini in 1982 showed that every 6-connected graph is rigid.  We give two further sufficient connectivity conditions for a  graph to be rigid.   Our proofs  surprisingly involve a discharging argument.  This is based on a joint work with Xiaofeng Gu, Wei Meng, Martin Rolek, and Yue Wang.

An edge-weighting vertex colouring of a graph G is a mapping f: E(G) &rarr; R such that for any edge uv of G, 
<span>&sum;</span> <sub>e &isin; E(u)</sub>f(e) &ne; <span>&sum;</span> <sub>e &isin; E(v)</sub> f(e).  
The well-known 1-2-3 conjecture asserts that any graph with no isolated edges has an edge-weighting vertex colouring using weights 1,2 and 3.  The list version of this conjecture asserts that if   each edge e is given a list L(e) of 3 real numbers as permissible weights, then there is an edge-weighting vertex colouring f using permissible  weights  for each edge e.  
   
In this talk, I will give a detailed sketch of the proof that 
if each edge e is given a list L(e) of 5 permissible weights, then there is an edge-weighting vertex colouring f using permissible weights from L(e) for each edge e.

_**Highly connected subgraphs of graphs with given independence number**_          [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rU4y1P7WE/)

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
Let G be a graph on n vertices with independence number &alpha;. How large a k-connected subgraph must G contain? Such a k-connected subgraph cannot be guaranteed to have more than &LeftCeiling;n/&alpha;&RightCeiling; vertices, since G might be the disjoint union of &alpha; near equal cliques. It turns out that if n is sufficiently large (n&ge;&alpha;<sup>2</sup>k+1 will do), then G always contains a k-connected subgraph on at least &LeftCeiling;n/&alpha;&RightCeiling; vertices. What is the correct threshold for n for which this result is true? Previously with Shinya Fujita and Amites Sarkar in 2018, we determined the exact thresholds for n when &alpha;=2,3. In this talk, we shall present a new result for &alpha;=4. For general  &alpha;, we also present an improvement on the bound n&ge;&alpha;<sup>2</sup>k+1. Finally, several open problems will be mentioned.

Joint work with Shinya Fujita (Yokohama City University, Japan), Boram Park (Ajou University, South Korea), and Amites Sarkar (Western Washington University, USA).

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
Given a graph G, a decomposition of G is a partition of its edges. A graph is   (d, h)-decomposable if its edge set can be partitioned into a d-degenerate graph and a graph with maximum degree at most h. For d &le; 4, we are interested in the minimum integer h<sub>d</sub> such that every planar graph is (d,h<sub>d</sub>)-decomposable. It was known that h<sub>3</sub> &le; 4, h<sub>2</sub> &le; 8, and h<sub>1</sub> = &infin;. In this talk, we present a result that h<sub>4</sub>=1, h<sub>3</sub>=2, and 4 &le; h<sub>2</sub> &le; 6.

_**Extremal problems for multigraphs**_    [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1n34y1Q768)

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
An (n,s,q)-graph is an n-vertex multigraph in which every s-set of vertices spans at most q edges. Turan-type questions on the maximum of the sum of the edge multiplicities in such multigraphs have been studied since the 1990s. More recently, Mubayi and Terry posed the problem of determining the maximum of the product of the edge multiplicities in
(n,s,q)-graphs. In this talk we will discuss recent progress on this problem, including a result that shows for infinitely many choices of (s,q), the solution is transcendental. This answers a question of Alon. This is joint work with Nick Day and Victor Falgas-Ravry.

_**Polynomial &chi;-binding functions for t-broom-free graphs**_      [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ef4y1L7Kj)

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
For any positive integer t, a t-broom is a graph obtained from K<sub>1,t+1</sub> by subdividing an edge once.  In this paper, we show that, for graphs G without induced t-brooms, we have &chi;(G) =  o(&omega;(G)<sup>t+1</sup>), where  &chi;(G) and &omega;(G) are the chromatic number and clique number of G, respectively. When t=2, this answers a question of  Schiermeyer and Randerath. Moreover, for t=2, we strengthen the bound on &chi;(G) to 7.5&omega;(G)<sup>2</sup>, confirming a conjecture of Sivaraman. For t &ge; 3 and {t-broom, K<sub>t,t</sub>}-free graphs, we improve the bound to o(&omega;(G)<sup>t-1+2/(t+1)</sup>). Joint work with Xiaonan Liu, Joshua Schroeder and Xingxing Yu.

In this entry point into the subject, combining two elementary proofs, we decrease the gap between the upper
and lower bounds by 0.2% in
a classical combinatorial number theory problem. We show that the
maximum size of a Sidon set of {1, 2,..., n} is at most
&radic;n+ 0.998n<sup>1/4</sup> for sufficiently large n.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
Celebrated theorems of Roth and of Matoušek and Spencer together show that the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions in the first n positive integers is &Theta;(n<sup>1/4</sup>). We study the analogous problem in the Z<sub>n</sub> setting. We asymptotically determine the logarithm of the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions in Z<sub>n</sub> for all positive integer n. We further determine up to a constant factor the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions in Z<sub>n</sub> for many n. For example, if n=p<sup>k</sup> is a prime power, then the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions in Z<sub>n</sub> is &Theta;(n<sup>1/3+r<sub>k</sub>/(6k)</sup>), where r<sub>k</sub> &isin; {0,1,2} is the remainder when k is divided by 3. This solves a problem of Hebbinghaus and Srivastav.

  A hole is an induced cycle of length at least 4. Let l&ge;2 be a positive integer, let &Gcirc;<sub>l</sub> denote the family of graphs which have girth 2l+1 and have no holes of odd length at least 2l+3, and let G &isin; &Gcirc;<sub>l</sub>.  For a vertex u &isin; V(G) and a nonempty set S &sube; V(G), let d(u,S) = min{d(u,v) : v&isin;S}, and let L<sub>i</sub>(S)={u&isin;V(G) and d(u,S)=i} for any  integer i&ge;0. We show that if G[S] is connected and G[L<sub>i</sub>(S)] is bipartite for each i&isin;{1,…,l-1}, then G[L<sub>i</sub>(S)] is bipartite for each i&gt;0, and consequently χ(G)&le;4, where G[S]  denotes the subgraph induced by S. For a graph G&isin; &Gcirc;<sub>2</sub>, we show that &chi;(G)&le;3 if G induces no two cycles of length 5 sharing edges. Let &theta;<sup>+</sup> be the graph obtained from the Petersen graph by removing two adjacent vertices. We show that if G &isin; &Gcirc;<sub>2</sub> is 3-connected and has no unstable 3-cutset, then G does not induce &theta;<sup>+</sup>. As a corollary, minimal non-3-colorable graphs of &Gcirc;<sub>2</sub> induce no &theta;<sup>+</sup>.  This is a joint work with Di Wu and Yian Xu.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>    
  
The Prague dimension of graphs was introduced by Nesetril, Pultr and Rodl in the 1970s: as a combinatorial measure of complexity, it is closely related to clique edges coverings and partitions.
Proving a conjecture of Furedi and Kantor, we show that the Prague dimension of the binomial random graph is typically of order n/(log n) for constant edge-probabilities. 
The main new proof ingredient is a Pippenger-Spencer type edge-coloring result for random hypergraphs with large uniformities, i.e., edges of size O(log n).

The following result is attributed to Lovász.

For every k\ge 1, there are graphs F_1, \ldots, F_{m_k} such that
a graph G has a vertex cover of size at most k if and only if G has
no (induced) subgraph isomorphic to any F_i.

In this talk I will explain a proof of the above result using the Łoś-Tarski
Theorem from model theory, and discuss its extensions to other graph
properties/classes, e.g., graphs of bounded tree-depth and graphs of 
bounded shrub-depth.

A simple yet vital step of our logic proof is to go from finite graphs
to infinite graphs, without which, we show that the Łoś-Tarski Theorem
fails on finite graphs.

  <summary>abstract</summary>
  
Zarankiewicz’s problem in graph theory asks to determine for each n and k the largest possible number of edges \|E\| in a  K_{k,k}-free bipartite graph G = (V_1, V_2; E) with \|V_1\|+\|V_2\|=n. Semialgebraic graphs enjoy stronger bounds than the usual Kovari-Sos-Turan bounds for general graphs, providing an abstract setting for the Szemerédi-Trotter theorem and related incidence bounds. We obtain even stronger bounds for semilinear graphs, demonstrate that these are close to being optimal, and apply them to show that the number of incidences between points and boxes with axis parallel sides on the plane whose incidence graph is K_{k,k}-free is almost linear. I will also discuss how these results are related to the notion of modularity in model theory. (Joint with Abdul Basit, Artem Chernikov, Sergei Starchenko, and Terence Tao).

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
  
A combinatorial structure is said to be quasirandom if it resembles a random
structure in a certain robust sense. The notion of quasirandom graphs,
developed in the work of Rödl, Thomason, Chung, Graham and Wilson in 1980s,
is particularly robust as several different properties of truly random graphs,
e.g., subgraph density, edge distribution and spectral properties, are satisfied
by a large graph if and only if one of them is.

We will discuss quasirandom properties of other combinatorial structures,
tournaments, permutations and Latin squares in particular, and present several
recent results obtained using analytic tools of the theory of combinatorial limits.

The talk is based on results obtained with different groups of collaborators,
including Timothy F. N. Chan, Jacob W. Cooper, Robert Hancock, Adam Kabela,
Ander Lamaison, Taísa Martins, Roberto Parente, Samuel Mohr, Jonathan A. Noel,

Let H be an infinite graph. In a two-coloring of the edges of the complete
graph on the natural numbers, what is the densest monochromatic subgraph
isomorphic to H that we are guaranteed to find? We measure the density of a
subgraph by the upper density of its vertex set. This question, in the
particular case of the infinite path, was introduced by Erdős and Galvin.
Following a recent result for the infinite path, we present bounds on the
maximum density for other choices of H, including exact values for wide classes
of bipartite graphs and infinite factors.

Graph compression or sparsification is a basic information-theoretic and computational question. A major open problem in this research area is whether (1+ϵ)-approximate cut-preserving vertex sparsifiers with size close to the number of terminals exist. As a step towards this goal, we study a thresholded version of the problem: for a given parameter c, find a smaller graph, which we call connectivity-c mimicking network, which preserves connectivity among k terminals exactly up to the value of c. We show that connectivity-c mimicking networks with O(kc^4) edges exist and can be found in time m(clogn)O(c). We also give a separate algorithm that constructs such graphs with k⋅O(c)^{2c} edges in time mc^O(c)polylog(n). These results lead to the first data structures for answering fully dynamic offline c-edge-connectivity queries for c≥4 in polylogarithmic time per query, as well as more efficient algorithms for survivable network design on bounded treewidth graphs.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>   
  
I will talk about a method which provides a unified framework for many stability theorems that have been proved in graph and hypergraph theory.
Our main result reduces stability for a large class of hypergraph  problems to the simpler question of checking that a  hypergraph H with large minimum degree that omits the forbidden structures is vertex-extendable. This means that if v is a vertex of H and H-v is a subgraph of the extremal configuration(s), then H is also a subgraph of the extremal configuration(s). In many cases vertex-extendability is quite easy to verify.
Our method always yields an Andrásfai-Erdős-Sós type result, which says if H has large minimum degree, 
then it must be a subgraph of one of the extremal configurations.

A subgraph of an edge-colored graph is rainbow if all of its edges have different
colors. For a given graph H, the anti-Ramsey number AR(n,H) of H is the maximum
number of colors in an edge-colored K_n such that K_n does not contain a copy of
rainbow H. We determine the exactly anti-Ramsey number for paths. This confirms
a conjecture posed by Erdős, Simonovits and Sós in 1970s.

Our main theorem, which improves results of Green and Morris, and of Mazur, implies that the following holds for every fixed lambda > 2 and every k>(log n)^4: if omega goes to infinity as n goes to infinity (arbitrarily slowly), then almost all sets A of \[n\] with \|A\|=k and \|A + A\|<lambda k are contained in an arithmetic progression of length lambda k/2 + omega.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
  
A striking result in graph theory is that the property of being quasirandom (i.e. resembling a random graph) can be characterised in several equivalent ways. One way is to say that the number of edges and the number of 4-cycles are both close to what one would expect in a random graph. Král’ and Pikhurko (2013) proved that quasirandom permutations are characterised by the densities of all permutations of length 4. We improve on this result by showing that there is a single expression consisting of a sum of densities of 8 permutations of length 4 whose value forces quasirandomness. Moreover, we characterize all permutation expressions of this type which force quasirandomness. Joint work with Timothy F. N. Chan, Daniel Král’, Yanitsa Pehova, Maryam Sharifzadeh and Jan Volec.

_**On graph norms for complex-valued functions**_    [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yh411y7Cu) 

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
   
For any given graph $H$, one may define a natural corresponding functional $\|.\|_H$ for real-valued functions by using homomorphism density. One may also extend this to complex-valued functions, once $H$ is paired with a $2$-edge-colouring $\alpha$ to assign conjugates. We say that $H$ is \emph{real-norming} (resp. \emph{complex-norming}) if $\|.\|_H$ (resp. $\|.\|_{H,\alpha}$) is a norm on the vector space of real-valued (resp. complex-valued) functions. These generalise the Gowers octahedral norms, a widely used tool in extremal combinatorics to quantify quasirandomness.
   
We unify these two seemingly different notions of graph norms in real- and complex-valued settings. Namely, we prove that $H$ is complex-norming if and only if it is real-norming and simply call the property \emph{norming}. Our proof does not explicitly construct a suitable $2$-edge-colouring $\alpha$ but obtains its existence and uniqueness, which may be of independent interest.
   
As an application, we give various example graphs that are not norming. In particular, we show that hypercubes are not norming, which resolves the last outstanding problem posed in Hatami's pioneering work on graph norms.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
   
In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let C(G) be the set of cycle lengths in a graph G and let C_odd(G) be the set of odd numbers in C(G). We prove that, if G has chromatic number k, then ∑_{ℓ∈C_odd(G)} 1/ℓ≥(1/2−o_k(1))log k. This solves Erdős and Hajnal's odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal.   
In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some d such that each graph with chromatic number at least d (or perhaps even only average degree at least d) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2.     
Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every k, there is some d so that every graph with average degree at least d has a subdivision of the complete graph K_k in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.

<details>

We examine the classical problem of ranking a set of players on the basis of a set of
pairwise comparisons arising from a sports tournament, with the objective of minimizing the total number of upsets,
where an _upset_ occurs if a higher ranked player was actually defeated by a lower ranked player. This problem
can be rephrased as the so-called minimum feedback arc set problem on tournaments, which arises in a rich variety
of applications and has been a subject of extensive research. We study this NP-hard problem using
structure-driven and linear programming approaches.

Let T=(V,A) be a tournament with a nonnegative integral weight
w(e) on each arc e. A subset F of arcs is called a _feedback arc set_ if T\F contains no cycles
(directed). A collection **C** of cycles (with repetition allowed) is called a _cycle packing_ if each arc
e is used at most w(e) times by members of **C**.  We call T _cycle Mengerian_  if, for every nonnegative
integral function w defined on A, the minimum total weight of a feedback arc set is equal to the maximum
size of a cycle packing. In this talk, we
will discuss the characterization that a tournament is cycle Mengerian if and only if it contains none of
four Möbius ladders as a subgraph. (Joint work with Guoli Ding, Wenan Zang, and Qiulan Zhao.)

<details>

 We study the approximate packing-covering duality, also known as the Erdős-Pósa property, of various families of paths and cycles with modularity constraints. Our main tool is a structure theorem for undirected group-labelled graphs refining the flat wall theorem of Robertson and Seymour, and as a first consequence we obtain the Erdős-Pósa property of cycles of length L mod m for any integer L and odd prime power m.
This partially answers a question of Dejter and Neumann-Lara from 1987 on characterizing all such integer pairs L and m. With some more work, we also prove the Erdős-Pósa property of A-paths of length 0 mod p for prime p, resolving a recent question of Bruhn and Ulmer and thereby characterizing when A-paths of length L mod m satisfy the Erdős-Pósa property.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
  
Graph edge coloring is a well established subject in the field of graph theory, it is one of the basic combinatorial optimization problems:  color the edges of a graph G with as few colors as possible such that each edge receives a color and adjacent edges, that is, different edges incident to a common vertex, receive different colors. The minimum number of colors needed for such a coloring of G is called the _chromatic index_ of G, written χ(G). By a result of Holyer, the determination of the chromatic index is an NP-hard optimization problem. The NP-hardness gives rise to the necessity of using heuristic algorithms. In particular, we are interested in upper bounds for the chromatic index that can be efficiently realized by a coloring algorithm. In this talk, we will start with  the well-known Goldberg-Seymour conjecture and its proof, then talk about the recent development of recoloring techniques and its applications to a number of classic problems in critical class 2 simple graphs.

In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$-colorable.  Recently, Norin, Song and I showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable for every $\beta > 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ bound. Here we show that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t (\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable for every $\beta > 0$; more specifically, they are $O(t (\log \log t)^{6})$-colorable.

<details>
  <summary>abstract</summary>
  
Hadwiger (Hajos and Gerards and Seymour, respectively) conjectured that 
the vertices of  every graph with no K_{t+1} minor (topological minor 
and odd minor, respectively) can be  colored with t colors such that any 
pair of adjacent vertices receive different colors. These conjectures 
are stronger than the Four Color Theorem and are either open or false 
in general. A weakening of these conjectures is to consider clustered 
coloring which only requires every monochromatic component to have 
bounded size instead of size 1. It is known that t colors are still 
necessary for the clustered coloring version of those three conjectures. 
Joint with David Wood, we prove a series of tight results about 
clustered coloring on graphs with no subgraph isomorphic to a fixed 
complete bipartite graph. These results have a number of applications. 
In particular, they imply that the clustered coloring version of Hajos’ 
conjecture is true for bounded treewidth graphs in a stronger sense: 
K_{t+1} topological minor free graphs of bounded treewidth are clustered 
t-list-colorable. They also lead to the first linear upper bound for the 
clustered coloring version of Hajos’ conjecture and the currently best 
upper bound for the clustered coloring version of the Gerards-Seymour 
conjecture.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
 Flow theory of signed graphs was introduced by  Bouchet as dual notion to local tensions of graphs embedded on non-orientable surfaces, which generalized Tutte's flow theory of ordinary graphs. Recently, we prove that every flow-admissible signed graph admits a nowhere-zero balanced $Z_2\times Z_3$-flow. This extends Seymour's 6-flow theorem from ordinary graphs (which are signed graphs without unbalanced circuit) to long-barbell-free signed graphs  (which are signed graphs without vertex-disjoint unbalanced circuits). In this talk, we will show how to apply this theorem to extend some classical results on flow and cycle decomposition/cover, due to  Jaeger, Fan, Alon-Tarsi, etc., to some signed graphs. Those classical results may not be tight for ordinary graphs, whose expected improvements are known as Tutte's $5$-flow Conjecture, Berge-Fulkerson Conjecture, Cycle Double Cover Conjecture and Shortest Cycle Cover Conjecture. In contrast, we shall see that the signed analogies of  those classical results are indeed sharp for certain signed graphs.

Among the numerous applications of the regularity lemma, a classical one is the graph removal lemma. It has applications in fields such as number theory and theoretical computer science. For every fixed graph H, the H-removal lemma gives a highly nontrivial equivalence between the density of H in G and the L1 distance between a graph G to the set of H-free graphs. Whether the huge bound in the quantitative estimate is necessary remains a big open question in graph theory. In this talk, I will discuss some recent works on a strengthening of the usual graph removal lemma.  This talk is based on some joint work with Jacob Fox.

then V(G) has a partition into sets A and B such that mad(G[A]) < a

Note that the vertices of the n-dimensional cube {0, 1}^n can be covered by two affine hyperplanes x_1=1 and x_1=0. However if we leave one vertex uncovered, then suddenly at least n affine hyperplanes are needed. This was a classical result of Alon and Füredi, followed from the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.

In this talk, we consider the following natural generalization of the Alon-Füredi theorem: what is the minimum number of affine hyperplanes such that the vertices in {0, 1}^n-{0} are covered at least k times, and 0 is uncovered? We answer the problem for k<=3 and show that a minimum of n+3 affine hyperplanes is needed for k=3, using a punctured version of the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. We also develop an analogue of the Lubell-Yamamoto-Meshalkin inequality for subset sums, and solve the problem asymptotically for fixed n and k->∞, and pose a conjecture for fixed k and large n.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
A well-known result of Verstraete states that for each integer k\geq 2 every graph G with
average degree at least 8k contains cycles of k consecutive even lengths, the shortest of which
is at most twice the radius of G.    

In this talk, we extend Verstraete's result for linear cycles in linear r-uniform hypergraphs, where r\geq 3.  
We show that for each k\geq 2, there exist constants c_1,c_2 depending only on r such
that every linear r-graph with average degree at least c_1 k contains linear cycles of k
consecutive even lengths and every linear r-graph with average degree at c_2k contains
linear cycles of k consecutive lengths. For the even consecutive lengths case, our bound
on the shortest cycle length among the cycles obtained is tight, which also yields improved
upper bound on the linear Turan number of an even cycle of given length. For the consecutive
lengths case, our bound on the shortest cycle length is tight within a constant factor.    

The talk will focus on the tools used in establishing the results. We think that these tools
can find further applications to other extremal problems on cycles in the hypergraph setting.

Let H be a k-partite k-graph with n vertices in each partition class,  and let
$\delta_{k-1}(H)$ denote the minimum co-degree of H. We characterize those H with $\delta_{k-1}(H) \geq n/2$ and with no perfect matching. As a consequence we give an affirmative answer to the following question of Rödl and Ruciński: If k is even or $n \not\equiv 2 \pmod 4$, does $\delta_{k-1}(H) \geq n/2$ imply that H has a perfect matching? We  give an example indicating that it is not sufficient to impose this degree bound on only two types of (k-1)-sets. For near perfect matching, we gave a tight sufficient condition in term of co-degree, which is also independently obtained by Han, Zang and Zhao.

for any integer k>= 2, ex\*(n,C_{2k})=O(n^{1+1/k}). This is tight and
establishes a conjecture of Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov and Verstraete. We
use the same method to prove several other conjectures in various
topics. For example, we give an upper bound for the Turán number of the
blow-ups of even cycles, which can be used to disprove a conjecture of
Erdős and Simonovits.

The conjecture on the realizability of rational exponents states that for every rational number r in (1,2) there is a graph F such that ex(n, F) = Θ(n^r). In their beautiful work, Bukh and Conlon resolved a weaker version of the conjecture, where F is allowed to be a family of graphs. Subsequent work has been focusing on narrowing this family down to a single graph. We formulate a framework, that is taking shape in recent work, to attack the conjecture, and we showcase an application of the framework to obtain infinitely many new Turán exponents.

Solving a longstanding problem on equiangular lines, we determine, for each given fixed angle and in all sufficiently large dimensions, the maximum number of lines pairwise separated by the given angle. The answer is expressed in terms of spectral radii of graphs.  

Generalizing to spherical two-distance sets, we conjecturally relate the problem to a certain eigenvalue problem for signed graphs, and solve it in a number of cases.   

A key ingredient is a new result in spectral graph theory: the adjacency matrix of a connected bounded degree graph has sublinear second eigenvalue multiplicity.

What does it mean for a structure to be _sparse_ or _dense_? What is the point of differentiating between sparse and dense structures?
Is there an objective and essential boundary between sparse and dense structures?
The aim of this talk is to address, at least partially, these questions, from the points of view of model theory, structural graph theory, and theoretical computer science.

  Let G be a connected unimodular group equipped with a Haar measure $\mu_G$, and suppose A,B are nonempty measurable subsets of G. An inequality by Kemperman gives us

mu_G(AB) \geq \min \{ \mu_G(A)+\mu_G(B), \mu_G(G)\}.

We obtain characterizations of groups G, and sets A, B, such that the equality holds. This is the first general result of its kind in nonabelian continuous settings and, at the same time, provides a complete answer to a question asked by Kemperman in 1964. We also get near equality versions of the above result with uniform linear bound for connected compact groups, confirming conjectures made by Griesmer and by Tao. As an application, we obtain a measure expansion result for connected compact simple Lie groups. (Joint work with Chieu-Minh Tran)

  The genus g(G) of a graph G is defined as the minimum genus of a surface
in which G can be embedded (drawn without crossings). Thomassen proved
that it is NP-hard to determine whether g(G) < k, when the graph G and
an integer k are given to us as the input. Robertson and Seymour (and
the speaker) proved that this problem is FPT (fixed-parameter
tractable). However, it is wide open whether the value of g(G) can be
approximated.  

The speaker will give an overview of this problem, describe underlying
conjectures, and present a complete solution for the case when the graph
is dense. The solution uses Szemeredi Regularity Lemma and a result on
the genus of quasi-random graphs.   

This is joint work with Yifan Jing.

  In recent decades, independent sets in the discrete hypercube has received a lot of attention from many notable researchers.
The classical result of Korshunov and Sapozhenko in 1983 counts the number of independent sets in the hypercube, and then shows that typical independent sets are not far from the trivial construction.  

For an odd integer n=2d-1, let B(n, d) be the subgraph of the hypercube induced by the two largest layers. 
Our new results describe the typical structure of independent sets in B(n, d) and also give precise asymptotics on the number of them.   
The proofs use Sapozhenko's graph container lemma, and a recently developed method of Jenssen and Perkins, which combines Sapozhenko's graph container lemma with a classical tool from statistical physics, the cluster expansion for polymer models.  

This is a joint work with Jozsef Balogh and Ramon I. Garcia.

  Suppose that Y_1, …, Y_N are i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) random variables and let X = Y_1 + … + Y_N. The classical theory of large deviations allows one to accurately estimate the probability of the tail events X < (1-c)E[X] and X > (1+c)E[X] for any positive c. However, the methods involved strongly rely on the fact that X is a linear function of the independent variables Y_1, …, Y_N. There has been considerable interest—both theoretical and practical—in developing tools for estimating such tail probabilities also when X is a nonlinear function of the Y_i. One archetypal example studied by both the combinatorics and the probability communities is when X is the number of triangles in the binomial random graph G(n,p).

The first talk of the series will give a very gentle introduction to the theory of large deviations and discuss the history of the large deviation problem for triangle counts. The second talk of the series will present a complete solution to the upper tail problem for triangle counts in G(n,p) that was obtained recently in a joint work with Matan Harel and Frank Mousset.

This is a gentle introduction to basics of the hypergraph container method introduced independently by Balogh, Samotij and Morris, and Saxton and Thomason. The method has seen numerous applications in extremal combinatorics and other related areas in the past decade. We will focus mostly on examples, illustrating how to apply this method on various types of problems.
