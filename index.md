This online seminar is organized by [Ping Hu](https://hupple.github.io/) ([SYSU](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm)), [Yan Wang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/teachershow/tags/MDAwMDAwMDAwMLKuetw) ([SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)), [Hehui Wu](http://www.scms.fudan.edu.cn/Data/View/432.html) ([SCMS](http://www.scms.fudan.edu.cn/)) and Qiqin Xie ([SHU](https://www.shu.edu.cn/)). We will run it every two weeks, and run [student seminars](student) in between.

## Current Schedule     

### Apr 8, 2022, 14:00-15:00 (UTC+8): [Ruonan Li](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/m/2018010102) (Northwestern Polytechnical University)
_**Properly colored cycles in edge-colored graphs and directed cycles in digraphs**_     
[zoom](https://zoom.us/j/85760276147) pw 121323      

A graph is called properly colored if adjacent edges are of distinct colors. In this talk, we will introduce some results and problems on properly colored cycles from a view of relation between edge-colored graphs and directed graphs. 

### Apr 22, 2022, 10:00-11:00 (UTC+8): [Alexandr V. Kostochka](https://kostochk.web.illinois.edu/) (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
_**On sizes of 1-cross intersecting set pair systems**_   
[zoom](https://zoom.us/j/86455947492?pwd=SEJXQ2JkQkUyTVY1bzdTUHNlQ014QT09) pw 061801

Let ${(A_i,B_i)}_{i=1}^m$ be a set pair system. Füredi, Gyárfás and Király called it $1$-cross intersecting if the size of intersection of $A_i$ and $B_j$ is $1$ when $i$ and $j$ are distinct, and $0$ if $i=j$. They studied such systems and their generalizations, and in particular considered $m(a,b,1)$, the maximum size of a $1$-cross intersecting set pair system in which  $\|A_i\|\le a$ and $\|B_i\|\le b$ for all $i$.

Answering one of their questions, Holzman proved that if $a,b\ge 2$, then $m(a,b,1)\le (29/30)\binom{a+b}{a}$. He also conjectured that the factor $29/30$ in his bound can be replaced by $5/6$. The goal of this talk is to sketch a proof of this conjectured bound.

This is joint work with Grace McCourt and Mina Nahvi.

### Mar 25, 2022: [Haoran Luo](mailto:haoranl8@illinois.edu) (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
_**On the Maximum $F_5$-free Subhypergraphs of $G^3(n,p)$**_     [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qq4y1v7HN/)     [slides](./slides/2022/20220325_randomF5.pdf)       

Denote by $F_5$ the $3$-uniform hypergraph on vertex set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with hyperedges $\{123,124,345\}$. Balogh, Butterfield, Hu, and Lenz proved that if $p > K \ln n /n$ for some large constant $K$, every maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n,p)$ is tripartite with high probability, and showed if $p_0 = 0.1\sqrt{\ln n} /n$, with high probability there exists a maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n,p_0)$ that is not tripartite. We sharpen the upper bound to be best possible up to a constant factor. We prove that when $p > C \sqrt{\ln n} /n $ for some large constant $C$, every maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n, p)$ is tripartite with high probability. In this talk, I will introduce the main technique we use to improve this bound.

This is a joint work with Igor Araujo and Jozsef Balogh.

### Mar 11, 2022: [Peter Van Hintum](https://sites.google.com/view/petervanhintum) (Oxford)
_**Sharp stability of the planar Brunn-Minkowski inequality**_   [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1su411q7SP)

We'll consider recent results concerning the stability of the classic Brunn-Minkowski inequality. In particular, we will look at the proof of sharp stability for sets in the plane. Assuming that the Brunn-Minkowski deficit $\delta=\|A+B\|^{\frac{1}{2}}/(\|A\|^\frac12+\|B\|^\frac12)-1$ is sufficiently small in terms of $t=\|A\|^{\frac{1}{2}}/(\|A\|^{\frac{1}{2}}+\|B\|^{\frac{1}{2}})$,  there exist homothetic convex sets $K_A \supset A$ and $K_B\supset B$ such that $\frac{\|K_A\setminus A\|}{\|A\|}+\frac{\|K_B\setminus B\|}{\|B\|} \le C t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\delta^{\frac{1}{2}}$. The key ingredient is to show for every $\epsilon,t>0$, if $\delta$ is sufficiently small then $\|\operatorname{co}(A+B)\setminus (A+B)\|\le (1+\epsilon)(\|\operatorname{co}(A)\setminus A\|+\|\operatorname{co}(B)\setminus B\|)$. This talk is based on joint work with Hunter Spink and Marius Tiba.

### Feb 25, 2022: [Sang-il Oum](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/home/sangil/) (Institute for Basic Science / KAIST)
_**Independent domination of graphs with bounded maximum degree**_      [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1VT4y1S7pX/)     [slides](./slides/2022/Independent_domination_20220225.pdf)
