_**The chromatic number of triangle-free hypergraphs**_  
[zoom]( https://zoom.us/j/89307471081?pwd=UFBnajM4RUQyNDJmMGVGbTFJZnUxQT09) pw: 061801

A classical result of Johansson showed that for any triangle-free graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, its chromatic number is $O(\Delta/\log\Delta)$. This result was later generalized to all rank 3 hypergraphs due to the work of Copper and Mubayi. In this talk, I will present a common generalization of the above results to all hypergraphs, and this is sharp apart from the constant. Moreover, our result implies, generalizes, and improves several earlier results on the chromatic number and also independence number of hypergraphs, while its proof is based on a different approach than prior works in hypergraphs (and therefore provides alternative proofs to them). In particular, as an application, we establish a bound on chromatic number of sparse hypergraphs in which each vertex is contained in few triangles, and thus extend results of Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov and Cooper and Mubayi from hypergraphs of rank 2 and 3, respectively, to all hypergraphs.

This is joint work with Luke Postle.

_**Counterexamples for chromatic and dichromatic number**_   [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bY411A7bc)    [slides](./slides/2022/talk_dichi_scms.pdf)

Abstract: I will present a counterexample to the following well-known conjecture: for every k, r, every graph G with clique number at most k and sufficiently large chromatic number contains a triangle-free induced subgraph with chromatic number at least r. This is related to colouring and $\chi$-boundedness in digraphs.

Joint work with Alvaro Carbonero, Patrick Hompe, and Benjamin Moore.

_**On sizes of 1-cross intersecting set pair systems**_   [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15S4y1c7mA) 

Let ${(A_i,B_i)}_{i=1}^m$ be a set pair system. Füredi, Gyárfás and Király called it $1$-cross intersecting if the size of intersection of $A_i$ and $B_j$ is $1$ when $i$ and $j$ are distinct, and $0$ if $i=j$. They studied such systems and their generalizations, and in particular considered $m(a,b,1)$, the maximum size of a $1$-cross intersecting set pair system in which  $\|A_i\|\le a$ and $\|B_i\|\le b$ for all $i$.

Answering one of their questions, Holzman proved that if $a,b\ge 2$, then $m(a,b,1)\le (29/30)\binom{a+b}{a}$. He also conjectured that the factor $29/30$ in his bound can be replaced by $5/6$. The goal of this talk is to sketch a proof of this conjectured bound.

This is joint work with Grace McCourt and Mina Nahvi.

### Apr 8, 2022: [Ruonan Li](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/m/2018010102) (Northwestern Polytechnical University)
_**Properly colored cycles in edge-colored graphs and directed cycles in digraphs**_      [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NA4y197nk) 

A graph is called properly colored if adjacent edges are of distinct colors. In this talk, we will introduce some results and problems on properly colored cycles from a view of relation between edge-colored graphs and directed graphs. 

### Mar 25, 2022: [Haoran Luo](mailto:haoranl8@illinois.edu) (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
_**On the Maximum $F_5$-free Subhypergraphs of $G^3(n,p)$**_     [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qq4y1v7HN/)     [slides](./slides/2022/20220325_randomF5.pdf)       

Denote by $F_5$ the $3$-uniform hypergraph on vertex set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with hyperedges $\{123,124,345\}$. Balogh, Butterfield, Hu, and Lenz proved that if $p > K \ln n /n$ for some large constant $K$, every maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n,p)$ is tripartite with high probability, and showed if $p_0 = 0.1\sqrt{\ln n} /n$, with high probability there exists a maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n,p_0)$ that is not tripartite. We sharpen the upper bound to be best possible up to a constant factor. We prove that when $p > C \sqrt{\ln n} /n $ for some large constant $C$, every maximum $F_5$-free subhypergraph of $G^3(n, p)$ is tripartite with high probability. In this talk, I will introduce the main technique we use to improve this bound.

This is a joint work with Igor Araujo and Jozsef Balogh.

_**Sharp stability of the planar Brunn-Minkowski inequality**_   [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1su411q7SP)

We'll consider recent results concerning the stability of the classic Brunn-Minkowski inequality. In particular, we will look at the proof of sharp stability for sets in the plane. Assuming that the Brunn-Minkowski deficit $\delta=\|A+B\|^{\frac{1}{2}}/(\|A\|^\frac12+\|B\|^\frac12)-1$ is sufficiently small in terms of $t=\|A\|^{\frac{1}{2}}/(\|A\|^{\frac{1}{2}}+\|B\|^{\frac{1}{2}})$,  there exist homothetic convex sets $K_A \supset A$ and $K_B\supset B$ such that $\frac{\|K_A\setminus A\|}{\|A\|}+\frac{\|K_B\setminus B\|}{\|B\|} \le C t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\delta^{\frac{1}{2}}$. The key ingredient is to show for every $\epsilon,t>0$, if $\delta$ is sufficiently small then $\|\operatorname{co}(A+B)\setminus (A+B)\|\le (1+\epsilon)(\|\operatorname{co}(A)\setminus A\|+\|\operatorname{co}(B)\setminus B\|)$. This talk is based on joint work with Hunter Spink and Marius Tiba.
