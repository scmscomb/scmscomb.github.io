## Current Schedule

### Apr 28, 2022,  9:00-10:00 (UTC+8):[Gang Yang](mailto:), University of Shanghai for Science and Technology
_**To be continued.**_  
Abstract:   
To be continued.

### Apr 14, 2022,  9:00-10:00 (UTC+8):[Guozhen Dai](mailto:), Zhejiang University  
_**Tail Bounds on the Spectral Norm of Sub-Exponential Random Matrices**_  
Abstract:   
Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ symmetric random matrix with independent but non-identically distributed entries. The deviation inequalities of the spectral norm of $X$ with Gaussian entries have been obtained by using the standard concentration of measure results in Gauss space which is unfortunately not suitable for the sub-Exponential case.  This talk concentrates on upper tail bounds of $\Vert X\Vert$ with sub-Exponential entries.  Our general method relies upon a crucial ingredient of a novel chaining argument that  essentially depends on the distribution of coordinates of a point on the unit sphere. What makes this approach work is the particular structure of the sets used for the chaining.

### Mar 31, 2022,  9:00-10:00 (UTC+8):[Heng Li](mailto:), Fuzhou University  
_**A step towards a general density Corradi-Hajnal Theore**_  
Abstract:   
For a nondegenerate $r$-graph $F$, large $n$, and $t$ in the regime $[0, c_{F} n]$, where $c_F>0$ is a constant depending only on $F$,
we present a general approach for determining the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-graph that does not contain $t+1$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$.
In fact, our method results in a rainbow version of the above result and includes a  characterization of the extremal constructions. Our approach applies to many well-studied hypergraphs (including graphs) such as the edge-critical graphs, the Fano plane,  the generalized triangles, hypergraph expansions, the expanded triangles, and hypergraph books.Our results extend old results of Simonovits and Moon on complete graphs and can be viewed as a step towards a general density version of the classical Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal Theorem.


## Past talks

### Mar 3, 2022,  9:00-10:00 (UTC+8):[Meiqiao Zhang](mailto:gracezhou@mail.sdu.edu.cn), Nanyang Technological University  
_**An Introdution to DP-color functions**_  
[slides](./slides/2022/ZhiqianWang1209.pdf) [video](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1h5xyu-bxPd_d5kFAJ3NaSQ) pw:3df2 
Abstract:   
DP coloring is a recently introduced generalization of proper coloring that is to take all possible compatibility or repulsion relationships between the colors used
on every pair of adjacent vertices into consideration. The DP color function was then defined based on the counting of DP colorings, and turns out to have a direct but complex relationship with the chromatic polynomial. In this talk, I will introduce the basic definition and research status of DP color functions.

### Dec 23, 2022,  15:30-16:30 (UTC+8):[Wenling Zhou](mailto:gracezhou@mail.sdu.edu.cn), Shandong University  
_**Integer colorings with no rainbow k-term arithmetic progression**_  
Abstract:   
In this talk, we study the rainbow Erd\H{o}s-Rothschild problem with respect to $k$-term arithmetic progressions. For a set of positive integers $S \subseteq [n]$,
an $r$-coloring of $S$ is \emph{rainbow $k$-AP-free} if it contains no rainbow $k$-term arithmetic progression. Let $g_{r,k}(S)$ denote the maximum number of rainbow $k$-AP-free $r$-colorings of $S$. For sufficiently large $n$ and fixed integers $r\ge k\ge 3$, we show that $g_{r,k}(S)\le g_{r,k}([n])$ for any proper subset $S\subset [n]$. Further, we prove that $\lim_{n\to \infty}g_{r,k}([n])/(k-1)^n  = \binom{r}{k-1}$. Our result is asymptotically best possible and implies that, almost all rainbow $k$-AP-free $r$-colorings of $[n]$ use at most $k-1$ colors. This is joint work with Hao Lin and Guanghui Wang.

### Dec 9, 2022,  10:00-11:00 (UTC+8):[Zhiqian Wang](mailto:1522686578@qq.com), Nankai University
_**On circular Chromatic Number of Signed Planar Graphs of Girth At Least 5**_  
[slides](./slides/2022/ZhiqianWang1209.pdf) [video](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_Y1pktf3Os_EjKZSmbJnjg) pw:6i1z  
Abstract:   
In 2020, X. Zhu et al. introduced the concept of circular $r$-coloring of a signed graph $(G, \sigma)$, which is the extension of circular $r$-coloring brought up by Vince in 1988. Recently, J. Li et al. introduced the concept of circular $r$-flow as the dual notion of circular $r$-coloring in the sense of signed planar graphs, and several results of edge connectivity and circular flow index (equivalently, girth and circular chromatic number) were obtained. In this paper, we extend their results and prove that for every signed planar graph of girth at least 5 with $n$ vertices, the circular chromatic number is no more than $4-\frac{12}{5n-4}$. At the end, we propose two conjectures from our work about signed version of 3-flow conjecture. This paper is joint work with Jiaao Li.

### Nov 25, 2022,  16:00-17:00 (UTC+8):Jinye He, University of Oxford
_**A non-uniform extension of Baranyai's Theorem**_  
[slides](./slides/2022/JinyeHe.pdf)  [video](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WrixRdL1X3_CYQWL6oNbXw) pw:7l0u  
Abstract:  
A celebrated theorem of Baranyai states that when $k$ divides $n$, the family $K_n^k$ of all $k$-subsets of an $n$-element set can be partitioned into perfect matchings. In other words, $K_n^k$ is $1$-factorable. In this paper, we determine all $n, k$, such that the family $K_n^{\le k}$ consisting of subsets of $[n]$ of size up to $k$ is $1$-factorable, and thus extend Baranyai's Theorem to the non-uniform setting. In particular, our result implies that for fixed $k$ and sufficiently large $n$, $K_n^{\le k}$ is $1$-factorable if and only if $n \equiv 0$ or $-1 \pmod k$. This talk is based on joint works with Hao Huang and Jie Ma.

### Nov 11, 2022,  10:00-11:00 (UTC+8):Lanchao Wang, Nanjing University  
[slides](./slides/2022/LanchaoWang.pdf)  [video](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QC0nTM3Pa_jdBwqwp7qXeQ?pwd=ajmy) pw:ajmy  
Abstract:   
Let $X$ and $Y$ be any two graphs of order $n$. The friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$ is a graph with vertex set consisting of all bijections $\sigma :V(X) \mapsto V(Y)$, in which two bijections $\sigma$, $\sigma'$ are adjacent if and only if they differ precisely on two adjacent vertices of $X$, and the corresponding mappings are adjacent in $Y$. The most fundamental question that one can ask about these friends-and-strangers graphs is whether or not they are connected.  Let $Lollipop_{n-k,k}$ be a lollipop graph of order $n$ obtained by  identifying one end of a path of order $n-k+1$ with a vertex of a complete graph of order $k$.  In this talk, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for $\mathsf{FS}(Lollipop_{n-k,k},Y)$ to be connected for all $2\leq k\leq n$. And we  determine, building off of a work of Alon, Defant, and Kravitz,  a threshold condition for when $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is connected when $X$ and $Y$ are random graphs with different edge probabilities. This talk is based on joint works with Yaojun Chen.

### Oct 28, 2022,  10:00-11:00 (UTC+8):Henry Simmons, Lowa State University  
Abstract:   
For an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\nu^{(m)}(H)$ denote the maximum size of a set $M$ of edges in $H$ such that every two edges in $M$ intersect in less than $m$ vertices, and let $\tau^{(m)}(H)$ denote the minimum size of a collection $C$ of $m$-sets of vertices such that every edge in $H$ contains an element of $C$. The fractional analogues of these parameters are denoted by  $\nu^{\*(m)}(H)$  and $\tau^{\*(m)}(H)$, respectively. Generalizing a famous conjecture of Tuza (1990) on covering triangles in a graph, Aharoni and Zerbib (2022) conjectured that for every $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$, $\tau^{(r-1)}(H)/\nu^{(r-1)}(H) \leq \lceil\frac{r+1}{2}\rceil$. In this talk, we prove bounds on the ratio between the parameters $\tau^{(m)}$ and $\nu^{(m)}$, and their fractional analogs.
