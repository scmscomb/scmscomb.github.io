_**On a conjecture of Bondy and Vince**_      
[Tencent meeting](https://meeting.tencent.com/dm/yKDH7oQExYJX) pw 121323

Abstract: Eröds et. al. asked whether every graph with minimum degree at least three contains two cycles whose lengths differ by one or two. This was answered affirmatively by Bondy and Vince in the following stronger theorem: with the exception of $K_1$ and $K_2$, every graph having at most two vertices of degree less than three contains two cycles of lengths differing by one or two.
They further conjectured that for any nonnegative integer $k$, except finitely many counterexamples, every graph with $k$ vertices of degree less than three contains two cycles whose lengths differ by one or two.
In this talk, we confirm this conjecture for all $k$.
